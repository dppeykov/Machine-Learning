## What is machine learning?
---
A way for a computer to act upon data and make a decision, that previously only a person could make.
The computer is using a model to be able to produce an answer.


**Applications of ML**: stocks prediction, self-driving cars, robots, vision procesing, translation services, language processing, etc.

**Goal of ML**: make the machines act more like humans

**Simplified path to machine learning**: data -> spreadsheets -> relational DBs -> no SQL DBs -> machine learning
