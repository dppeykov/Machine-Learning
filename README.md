## SECTION 1: ML 101

### What is machine learning?

> A way for a computer to act upon data and make a decision, that previously only a person could make.
> The computer is using a model to be able to produce an answer. 
> The answer could help making business descisions, finding medical problems, etc.

> ML is using an algorithm or computer program to learn about different patterns in data and then take that algorithm (model) and using it to make predictions by feeding it similar data.

**Applications of ML**: stocks prediction, self-driving cars, robots, vision procesing, translation services, language processing, etc.

**Goal of ML**: make the machines act more like humans

**Simplified path to machine learning**: data -> spreadsheets -> relational DBs -> no SQL DBs (Big Data) -> machine learning

**Terms:**

[ Artificial Inteligence [ Machine Learning (ML) [ Deep learning ]]]

[ Artificial Inteligence [ Data Science (DS) [ Machine Learning [ Deep learning ]]]]

DS and ML overlap each other and both use deepl learning and ML techiques => ML, DS specialist is overchanging term (job position)

**Types of ML:**

 - Supervised - the data already has categories: classification (draw a line between the categories), regression (predicitng)
 - Unsupervised - the machine need to create the groups: clustering (decides based on the data), association rule learning
 - Reinforcement learning - the machine learns through trial and error - skill accuisition and real time learning
